**Descriptions of use-cases before letting AI go-for-it in generating diagrams etc.**

## Use case 1: Care Hire
-	A care hire company wants to know that I can drive a class C vehicle in the UK. Rather than providing them with the singed information from my:
 - Driving license
 - License translation
 - Visa status
 - Criminal check history
 - Passport
-	And for them having to use licensed software to describe the business logic of:
 - What licenses are legally transferrable to be used with class C vehicles
 - Checking whether I have a valid visa status
 - Whether my visa status allows me to hire a care
-	I instead have a rule in my personal data store stating that:
 - Certified car hire companies,
 - have permission to read data describing the classes of car that I am allowed to hire, but
 - are obliged to hold that information for only the length of the car hire,

There are a couple of versions of this which we consider:
-	Version 1:
  - All the signed data and business logic already sits within the users PDS / wallet
  - Query is executed in single environment
-	Version 2:
  - The car dealer defines 
  - This is where WP 7.5 Protocol Whiteboarding / Query Planning comes in to play
-	Version 3 (Policy awareness):
  - Policy awareness
-	Version 4 (Paying the govt. for business logic):
  - One way of the government using this exercise to retain a profit is to not directly issue signed rules but instead issue signed derivations (which could be implemented by setting the policy of what they are willing to disclose, and an obligation that they are paid to issue certain statements).*
*On issuer payments: One POC for this SToTW article could be to issue a public but encrypted version of the derived statement and prove that the indended recipient is in a position to decrypt it.

Use case 2: Data trust collecting health data for cancer research
