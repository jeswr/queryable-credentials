Access management for e-resources. The user-flow is:
-	I want to read ISO37124 in my e-reader (which, if no other defined default is available - will be my browser).
-	I am a student at the University of Oxford, and thus, the University is paying for the access rights for that document through an existing contract with ISO.
-	Rather than needing to discover and read that document through a separate search interface (in this case [SOLO](https://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/discovery/search?query=any,contains,ISO%2068-1:2023&tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&vid=44OXF_INST:SOLO&offset=0)), I want my e-reader/browser to be:
   - Aware that I am a member of the University of Oxford
   - Able to derive a credential using a public ISO rule-set stating that members of the University of Oxford have access to all ISO resources
   - Automatically present that credential to SOLO
-	In the vision of Oshaniâ€™s thesis, the document should be returned with usage controls which my browser would support me in enforcing
