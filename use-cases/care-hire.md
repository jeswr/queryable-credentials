# Care Hire Use Case

## Overview

This use case describes how a care hire company can verify a customer's eligibility to drive a Class C vehicle in the UK without directly accessing sensitive personal documents.

In the traditional approach, the customer would need to provide multiple documents such as:

- Driving license
- License translation (if applicable)
- Visa status
- Criminal check history
- Passport

The car hire company would then need to use licensed software to:

- Determine which licenses are legally transferable to be used with Class C vehicles
- Check whether the customer has a valid visa status
- Verify whether the visa status allows the person to hire a car

Instead, with queryable credentials, the customer can have a rule in their personal data store that:

- Allows certified car hire companies to read only the data about which classes of car they are permitted to hire
- Ensures the company is obliged to hold that information only for the duration of the car hire

    CA->>CHC: Issues certification credential to car hire company
    Customer->>PDS: Stores credentials (driving license, visa, etc.)
    Customer->>PDS: Sets data access rules
  
    CHC->>Customer: Requests driving eligibility data
    Customer->>PDS: Forwards request to personal data store
    PDS->>PDS: Validates car hire company certification
    PDS->>PDS: Applies access rules
    PDS->>CHC: Returns only eligibility information for Class C vehicles
    Note over CHC: Storage limited to car hire duration
    CHC->>Customer: Approves car hire based on returned data

This example demonstrates how queryable credentials can simplify the car hire process while protecting privacy and ensuring data minimization. The car hire company gets only the information it needs (ability to drive Class C vehicles in the UK), without handling or storing unnecessary sensitive personal documents.
