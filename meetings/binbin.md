Thank you for introducing your work and expressing interest in ours. As I’m approaching graduation, I may not have the time to engage in a collaboration, but I’d like to share some thoughts that may help you with your project:
 - If your goal is simply to ensure that the query result is accurate and derived from signed statements issued by trusted entities, you might not need zero-knowledge proofs. A signature technique could suffice to verify that the result is generated by a trusted database owner (or entity). However, zero-knowledge proofs are valuable in scenarios where clients do not trust the database owner and/or the query execution process. It's important to clarify the specific trust model and requirements of your project.
 - When integrating zero-knowledge proofs with a database engine, the key is to build a middle layer that translates SQL queries into specific circuits (e.g., PLONKish circuits, as introduced in PoneglyphDB). This translation is crucial because the zero-knowledge proof is generated based on these circuits, which must be agreed upon by both the database owner and the clients. 
 - Our open-source implementation of PoneglyphDB is available at GitHub. It is currently a prototype and experimental implementation. Developing a production-ready version will require further effort and refinements. In the meantime, we have included some simple examples to help you explore and experiment with zero-knowledge proofs.
